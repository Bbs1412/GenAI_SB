## Problem Statement
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Our client, NewsSphere, is a leading news organization dedicated to expanding its global reach and enhancing audience engagement. With a vast amount of content published daily in multiple languages, the organization faces the considerable challenge of manually creating quizzes and
assessments for each article. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistencies across different languages and cultural contexts.

## Our Solution

### Objective:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Develop an AI-driven question generator for client to create relevant questions across multiple languages.

### Scope:
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Implement language detection, translation, and question generation using Generative models and Machine translation services.

### Approach:
1. **User Input:** User submits a news article in any language.

1. **Language Detection:** The app utilizes the Translation API to detect the language of the submitted content.

1. **Translation to English:** If the content is not in English, the app translates it into English using the Translation API.

1. **Question Generation:** The app calls the Gemini API to generate diverse and contextually relevant questions based on the English version of the news article.
  
1. **Translation Back:** The generated questions are translated back into the original language of the news article using the Translation API.

1. **Output:** The app presents the questions in the original language to the user.
